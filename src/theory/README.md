# Music theory in BQN

- [Scales](scale.md) are the groups of notes used as "context" in most music.
- [Tertian scales](tertian.md) include the standard major and minor, many useful variations, and some oddities like the whole-tone scale.
- [Tertian-complement scales](complement.md) include some nice pentatonic scales, and share lots of theory with tertians.
- [Tertian scale modulation](modulation.md) describes the structure of 7-note tertian scales in terms of which can modulate to others by changing a single note.
- [Symmetric scales](symmetric.md), a note about scales that repeat periodically.
